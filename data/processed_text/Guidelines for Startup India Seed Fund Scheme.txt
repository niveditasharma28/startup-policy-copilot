1. Introduction  
Easy availability of capital is essential for entrepreneurs at the early stages of 
growth of an enterprise. Funding from angel investors and venture capital firms 
becomes available to startups only after the proof of concept has been provided. 
Similarly, banks provide loans only to asset -backed applicants. It is essential to 
provide seed funding to startups with an innovativ e idea to conduct proof of 
concept trials.  
Startup India Seed Fund Scheme (SISFS) aims to provide financial assistance to 
startups for proof of concept, prototype development, product trials, market entry 
and commercialization. This would enable these star tups to graduate to a level 
where they will be able to raise investments from angel investors or venture 
capitalists, or seek loans from commercial banks or financial institutions.  
The Seed Fund will be disbursed to eligible startups through eligible incu bators 
across India.  
2. The Requirement  
The Indian startup ecosystem suffers from capital inadequacy in the seed and 
‘Proof of Concept’ development stage. The capital required at this stage often 
presents a make or break situation for startups with good busi ness ideas. Many 
innovative business ideas fail to take off due to the absence of this critical capital 
required at an early stage for proof of concept, prototype development, product 
trials, market entry and commercialization. Seed Fund offered to such pr omising 
cases can have a multiplier effect in validation of business ideas of many 
startups, leading to employment generation.
